This paper presents a complete cycle of image classification convolutional neural networks. Data sets used in
to this paper are the ibean and plantaeK datasets. A theoretical description of the used ones is given procedures and methods, the data sets used are described, shown is the process of data preprocessing and classification model training, and the obtained results of the model were discussed.
